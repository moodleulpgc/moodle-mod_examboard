The module allows to define Examinations with a multi-members board of evaluators (teachers assessing an Exam, Dissertation Project etc.). Exach board is assigned to assess some students. Each student has a main Tutor and co-tutors. 
Students submit a work, Tutors submit a Report about the student. Each Board member grade separately the work and the final grade is the mean of the individual grades. 

The module provide ways to manage Board sessions, set dates, rooms, videoconefrence links, for the Examination, move students from one session to others, notify participants etc. Data can be exported as CSV or spreadsheet files and imported from CSV files. There are tools for manul or random assignment of users as Evaluators (Board mebers) of given sets os students, or the other way around, given a Board with teacher members, assign students randomly but avoiding having teacher as evaluator and tutor in the same examination.
